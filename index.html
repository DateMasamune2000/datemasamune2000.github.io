			<h2>About this website</h2>
			<p>
			Welcome to my website! My mission is to provide the resources necessary for
			a programmer to become a Real Programmer. For those who don't know
			what a Real Programmer is, here is
			<a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rni/papers/realprg.html">an article
			by someone far smarter than myself explaining it</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			I don't know Fortran (at least not well), but I am of the opinion that you
			don't have to be a Fortran programmer to be a real programmer. This is
			mostly because every reasonable modern language has some scope for
			cleverness and creativity, without which the act of programming becomes
			boring and devoid of life.
			</p>

			<p>
			In more concrete terms, this website aims to teach the things that you
			probably shouldn't do if you're working for somebody else's software project,
			but can. Things like <font family="monospace">goto</font> in C and arithmetic
			<font family="monospace">if</font> statements in Fortran (that date back to
			when the language was spelled with capital letters) are welcome here, as
			are "approaches" to programming like combining integer overflows with
			pointer arithmetic.
			<p>

			<h2>About me</h2>
			Like Tumblr girls listing mental illnesses in their bios, real programmers
			are expected to list their preferred language and platform wherever they are
			awarded the opportunity to do so. Here are mine.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Preferred Platform:</b> GNU/Linux, though I've tried and like NetBSD.
				I occasionally write code in Windows 3.1 inside of DOSBox too, particularly
				when I'm bored.</li>
				<li><b>Preferred Programming Languages:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>C (Speaks for itself)</li>
						<li>C++ (Those who associate this language with C are ignorant beyond
						belief. C forces everyone to be a Real Programmer, but C++ has features
						that Real Programmers like to abuse that C lacks).</li>
						<li>80x86 and AMD64 assembly (Unlike RISC fanboys that wax poetic about
						"elegant" and "minimalist" instruction sets, Real Programmers challenge
						themselves with the idiosynchracies of a very specific architecture)</li>
						<li>Common Lisp (because any language that allows easy macros
						automatically lets clever programmers abuse them)</li>
						<li>Perl (Speaks for itself but speaks so fluently that it goes over
						the heads of all other than its programmers, with most lacking the
						intellectual capacity to distinguish its programs from line noise).</li>
						<li>Brainf__k (Pure Turing machine. You can almost hear it speaking in a
						British accent while sipping a cup of tea.).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Preferred editor:</b> vim (the only other editors Real Programmers use are
				ed and TECO. Emacs is an IDE and belongs nowhere near a Real Programmer unless
				extensively customized).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Though the "likes" section is accompanied usually by a "dislikes" section, real
			programmers are competent enough to write transpilers. They usually just write their
			Fortran (pre-77 of course) or C and out comes the complete COBOL/Java code.</p>
